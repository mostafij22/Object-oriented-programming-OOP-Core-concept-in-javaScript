Classes are blueprints of an Object
a) A class can have many Objects because
b) Class is a template while Objects are instances of the class
c) Using let or var to declare variables inside a class is unnecessary because class
properties are automatically scoped to the class instance and don't require explicit
variable declarations.


//Class er Object toiri kore kaj and multiple object toiri kora jai
//Class er properties call hoy sob somoy object theke
